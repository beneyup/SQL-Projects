# [Instagram Clone Project](https://github.com/beneyup/SQL-Projects/tree/master-branch)
In this project, we'll investigate a database and find answers for questions like :
* What day of the week do most users register on?
* Which users have not posted any photos?
* Which users liked every single photo on the clone website?


## Authors

- [@beneyup](https://www.github.com/beneyup)


Tables that we'll create:
* users
* photos
* follows
* comments
* likes
* tags
* photo_tags
# Warnings

```
